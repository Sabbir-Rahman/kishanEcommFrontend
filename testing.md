There are two basic parts in react testing

## 1/Functional 
## 2/Non function

For Functional we will use 4 phase of testing
# 1/Unit testing 
# 2/ Integration testing
# 3/ E2E testing
# 4/ Smoke testing

For automation test primary plan to use 
    jest -> Unit & Integration testing
    engyme -> For component output
    cypresss-> For virtual browser testing
Will use coverage testing to have an estimation of testing percentage

We will try to follow tdd( test driven development)
