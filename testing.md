There are two basic parts in react testing

## 1/Functional 
## 2/Non function

For Functional we will use 4 phase of testing
# 1/Unit testing 
# 2/ Integration testing
# 3/ E2E testing
# 4/ Smoke testing

We will use jest, engyme, cypresss till now for testing
Will use coverage testing to have an estimation of testing percentage

We will try to follow tdd( test driven development)
